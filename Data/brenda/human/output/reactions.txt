The first step involves the activation of the catalytic Cys241 by deprotonation and subsequent substrate binding. Once Cys241 is deprotonated, it performs a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the fatty aldehyde, which forms a thiohemiacetal. Asn112 supports the orientation of the polar head group by coordinating to the substrate oxygen and subsequently stabilizes a tetrahedral reaction intermediate. In a second step, the collapse of the primarily formed oxyanion then initiates a hydride transfer to the NAD cofactor in a pro-R manner. Subsequently, a water molecule is deprotonated by Glu207 or Glu331 and triggers a nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide anion on the carbonyl carbon. In a final step, a repeated collapse of the oxyanion forms the fatty acid product and releases the covalent bond to Cys241, which remains activated or can be potentially reactivated	literature	743336	organism	Homo sapiens

GLDC is an unusual PLP-containing alpha-amino acid decarboxylase that removes carbon dioxide from the glycine substrate without releasing the expected amine (methylamine, a metabolic precursor of toxic formaldehyde) as a product. In an unusual decarboxylation mechanism, the resulting aminomethyl moiety is instead transferred to an accessory H-protein. (1) H-Protein is not required for glycine decarboxylation but, instead, is required for the release of the aminomethyl moiety from the quinonoid adduct. (2) Glycine decarboxylation is reversible and presumably proceeds through a stable quinonoid intermediate. (3) The physiological product of glycine decarboxylation is H-protein-S-aminomethyl dihydrolipoyllysine and not methylamine (in the absence of H-protein, the aminomethyl moiety remains as a quinonoid adduct)	literature	741906	organism	Homo sapiens

The lowest barriers are obtained for a mechanism where the substrate attacks a Mo-bound oxo ligand, directly forming a Mo-bound sulfate complex, which then dissociates into the products. The activation energy is dominated by the Coulomb repulsion between the Mo complex and the substrate. The general catalytic cycle for sulfite oxidase includes the molybdenum ion refering to the molybdenum cofactor, and the iron ion refering to the heme, at the start of the catalytic cycle, Mo is in the oxidized +VI state and the heme group is in the Fe(III) state. Then SO3- binds and is oxidized to SO42-, while the Mo ion is reduced to the +IV state. To complete the catalytic cycle, the reduced Mo ion binds water and is reoxidized to the +VI state in two coupled one-electron/proton-transfer steps, proceeding via a transient Mo(V)-OH-state to form the active Mo(VI)=O form of the cofactor. The electrons are transferred via reduction of the heme, which subsequently is reoxidized by cytochrome c.

To initiate the reaction the ferrous LOX is first activated by peroxide-dependent oxidation to a ferric form.

The enzyme then catalyzes a homolytic cleavage of the hydroperoxy bond, which leads to the formation of an oxygen-centered alkoxy radical, a hydroxyl and oxidizes the ferrous iron to a ferric form. Then the enzyme binds a linoleic acid molecule (or an alterative reductant such as guaiacol) and releases a carbon-centered linoleic radical. This reaction reduces the ferric LOX back to its ferrous form to start the next catalytic cycle.

ecNumber	2.3.1.16	reaction	acyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA = CoA + 3-oxoacyl-CoA	commentary	mechanism of the reverse, degradative thiolase reaction, overview. The mode of binding of the acyl moiety favours its transfer to CoA compared with water. Both the thiolytic cleavage and the condensation reaction are catalysed via covalent modification of the nucleophilic cysteine (Cys92) and by stabilization of the negatively charged reaction intermediates by oxyanion holes. The nucleophilic cysteine attacks the beta-carbon of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA and becomes covalently modified. Another cysteine, Cys382, acts first as an acid providing a proton for the leaving acetyl-CoA and next as a base abstracting a proton from the incoming CoA. The activated CoA molecule then attacks the carbonyl C atom of the acylated cysteine and the fatty acyl-CoA is released. The cysteine acting as the nucleophile is activated by a conserved histidine residue (His352). This protonated histidine subsequently forms OAH1 together with a water molecule which is hydrogen-bonded to Asn320. The rate-limiting steps are different in the degradative and biosynthetic thiolases	literature	735368	organism	Homo sapiens

ecNumber	2.9.1.2	reaction	O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNASec + selenophosphate + H2O = L-selenocysteinyl-tRNASec + 2 phosphate	commentary	proposed pyridoxal 5'-phosphate mechanism of L-phosphoseryl-tRNA to L-selenocysteinyl-tRNA conversion: the reaction begins by the covalently attached O-phospho-L-serine being brought into the proximity of the Schiff base when L-phosphoseryl-tRNASec binds to the enzyme. The amino group of O-phospho-L-serine can then attack the Schiff base formed between Lys284 and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, which yields an external aldimine. The reoriented side chain of Lys284 abstracts the Calpha proton from O-phospho-L-serine, and the electron delocalization by the pyridine ring assists in rapid beta-elimination of the phosphate group, which produces an intermediate dehydroalanyl-tRNASec. After phosphate dissociation and binding of selenophosphate, the concomitant attack of water on the selenophosphate group and of the nucleophilic selenium onto the highly reactive dehydroalanyl moiety yield an oxidized form of L-phosphoseryl-tRNASec. The protonated Lys284, returns the proton to the Calpha carbon and then attacks pyridoxal 5'-phosphate to form an internal aldimine. Finally, Sec-tRNASec is released from the active site	literature	695136	organism	Homo sapiens

ecNumber	3.1.3.2	reaction	a phosphate monoester + H2O = an alcohol + phosphate	commentary	the dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine by PAP is a two-step process: the first step involves the transfer of a phosphate group from the substrate to the histidine (His12). A number of quantum models are constructed containing various residues that are thought to play a role in the mechanism. In all these models, the transition state displays an associative character. The transition state is stabilized by three active site arginines (Arg11, Arg15, and Arg79), two of which belong to the conserved motif (RHGXRXP). His12 can act as a nucleophile. The enzyme is further characterized by a His257-Asp258 motif. Asp258 acts as a proton donor which becomes protonated when the substrate enters the binding pocket. The transfer of a proton from Asp258 to the leaving group is possibly mediated by a water molecule in the active site. The importance of His257 in lowering the energy barrier for the nucleophilic attack is shown	literature	692774	organism	Homo sapiens

In the first step, nucleophilic sulfhydryl group of Cys28 approaches Cd of the amide group of the N-terminal glutamine and becomes deprotonated by His81. The sulfhydryl group of Cys28 plays a crucial role in the nucleophilic attack on acyl group in the N-terminal glutamine side chain of substrates, which results in formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. Asp97 facilitates the process by forming a hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions with His81. The ammonia is released upon productive collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate and a water molecule enters the active site cavity and attacks S-acyl intermediate to convert glutamine to a glutamate. As the final step, the glutamate side chain is cleaved from S-acyl of Cys28. His81 first acts as a general base activation water for a nucleophilic attack on the S-acyl intermediate, and then upon collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate acts a general acid to protonate the leaving group, i.e. the thiolate of Cys28. The substrate peptide with newly formed N-terminal glutamate is released from the binding cleft at this stage and the enzyme is ready for another round of catalysis	literature	741295	organism	Homo sapiens

Coordination of one of the hydroxyl groups of the gem-diol to a Ca2+ ion facilitates the development of a negative charge on the O atom as its proton is lost to a base. The negatively charged O atom nucleophilically attacks the sulfur centre of the N-linked sulfate group on the glucosamine substrate (step 2), resulting in a covalently bound enzyme-substrate complex with a pentavalent sulfur transition state. An acid (possibly His181) facilitates the cleavage of the S-N bond by protonating the bridging N atom to form an amine leaving group on the N-desulfated substrate, which diffuses away, leaving an O-sulfated enzyme (step 3). Finally, in a step that underlines the importance of the formylglycine residue, another base (His125) deprotonates the second hydroxyl group, resulting in a negatively charged O atom (step 4) that forms a double bond with the C- atom as the C-O bond between it and the bridging O atom of the sulfate group breaks, eliminating the sulfate ion and regenerating the formylglycine residue (step 5)	literature	733005	organism	Homo sapiens

In the initial light-independent step, a 6-iminium ion is thought to be generated via proton transfer induced by two histidines highly conserved among the (6-4) photolyases.This intermediate spontaneously rearranges to form an oxetane intermediate by intramolecular nucleophilic attack. In the subsequent light-driven reaction, one electron is believed to be transferred from the fully reduced FAD cofactor (FADH-) to the oxetane intermediate thus forming a neutral FADH radical and an anionic oxetane radical, which spontaneously fractures.

The subsequent attack of K56 on the cofactor forms the Schiff base and releases D-serine as the product. If the starting substrate is D-serine, S84 is likely to be protonated, favoring the extraction of hydrogen from the Calpha atom of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-D-serine. The resulting planar intermediate allows K56 amino group to provide a proton from the si-face, restoring the L-serine intermediate.
