ecNumber	2.7.11.18	posttranslationalModification	phosphoprotein	commentary	reversible Ser/Thr and Tyr nmMLCK phosphorylation contributes to differential regulation of enzymatic activity and cellular spatial targeting of the kinase. cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of nmMLCK exerts paradoxical effects on kinase activity depending on whether the Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites resides within the unique nmMLCK N-terminus, the putative Src homology (SH) 3-binding sequences, or the calcium/calmodulin binding region. Tyr phosphorylation of nmMLCK by pp60src or c-Abl occurs during barrier disruption, during recovery, as well as following exposure to barrier enhancing stimuli. pp60src- or c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of nmMLCK at Y464 and Y471 increases MLC kinase activity. The two major nmMLCK splice variants, nmMLCK1 (about 211 kDa) and nmMLCK2 (about 203 kDa), differ by 69 amino acids within exon 11 (partially deleted in nmMLCK2), a stretch that contains the highly phosphorylated Y464 and Y471, suggesting that nmMLCK splice variants are differentially regulated by Tyr phosphorylation	organism	Homo sapiens	literature	741240

ecNumber	2.7.11.20	posttranslationalModification	phosphoprotein	commentary	eEF2K activity is also regulated by phosphorylation. Ser366 is phosphorylated by S6 kinases, enzymes which are phosphorylated and activated by mTORC1, phosphorylation at this site desensitizes eEF2K to activation by Ca2+/CaM. Phosphorylation of Ser359, a site whose modification strongly inhibits eEF2K, and Ser78, immediately next to the CaM-binding motif, are also promoted by mTORC1. The latter strongly impairs the interaction of eEF2K with CaM thereby impairing its activation. For eEF2K stimulation, cAMP, a catabolic signal which inhibits protein synthesis, stimulates cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, which phosphorylates eEF2K at Ser500. Degradation of eEF2K requires the autophosphorylation site at Ser445, which forms part of a typical bTrCP-binding motif or phosphodegron. eEF2K is also phosphorylated at several sites in response to activation of stress-stimulated MAP kinase cascades, either directly by MAPKs or by their downstream effectors.

ecNumber	5.3.4.1	posttranslationalModification	more	commentary	PDIp exists predominantly as monomer under reducing conditions, but the dimeric form is significantly increased following the removal of the reducing agent, due to the formation of an inter-subunit disulfide bond. The oxidized PDIp exposes more hydrophobic patches and is more sensitive to protease digestion. The formation of the inter-subunit disulfide bond is mainly contributed by its non-active cysteine residue C4. The formation of the inter-subunit disulfide bond is redox-dependent and is favored under oxidizing conditions. PDIp can function as a chaperone to form stable complexes with various non-native cellular proteins, particularly under oxidizing conditions	organism	Homo sapiens	literature	690633

Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analyses shows that CTP synthetase 1 is phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues. It is indicated that protein kinase C phosphorylation at Ser462 stimulates human CTP synthetase 1 activity, whereas phosphorylation at Thr455 inhibits activity	organism	Homo sapiens	literature	674816	
ecNumber	6.3.4.2	posttranslationalModification	phosphoprotein	commentary	it is shown that Ser-574 and Ser-575 are phosphorylated residues. Mutation of Ser-571 demonstrates that Ser-571 is the major site phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 in intact human embryonic kidney 293 cells by glycogen synthase kinase 3 in vitro. Mutation of Ser-575 prevents phosphorylation of Ser-571, suggesting phosphorylation of Ser-575 is necessary for priming the glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation of Ser-571; stimulation/inhibition of protein kinase A and protein kinase C does not alter the phosphorylation of endogenous human CTPS1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Low serum conditions increased phosphorylation of endogenous CTPS1 and phosphorylation is inhibited by the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor indirubin-3Â’-monoxime and GSK3beta short interfering RNAs, demonstrating the involvement of glycogen synthase kinase 3 in phosphorylation of endogenous human CTPS1	organism	Homo sapiens	literature	674862

The S568A mutation has a greater effect on the glutamine than ammonia-dependent activity; Low serum treatment increases CTPS2 phosphorylation.
